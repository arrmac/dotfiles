Doug's Dot Files
===============

    git clone git@github.com:doug/dotfiles.git --recursive ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./setup.sh (if first time) or rake install (if reinstalling/linking)

This is for people who use vim, zsh, and tmux.

I also recommend checking out [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for your terminal
colors.

Use setup.sh to additionally install rvm, pythonbrew, some fonts, homebrew (if on OSX)

ZSH files provided by [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
VIMFILES are my collection of other peoples gitrepos as submodules with my own and others twists
The rake file was modded from [ryanb's dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles)
